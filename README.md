# Recursive Summarizer

I use this to summarize videos which were transcribed using Whisper. For
this use-case, I use vtt2txt (included).

Forked from [daveshap/RecursiveSummarizer](https://github.com/daveshap/RecursiveSummarizer). This fork uses less .txt files and takes two arguments for
input and output.

It also create a grand summary of summaries at the end.

For processing, you can use process_vtt.sh
